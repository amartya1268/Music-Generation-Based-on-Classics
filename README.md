# Music-Generation-Based-on-Classics


Our objective was to explore the MusicNet dataset, a compilation of classical music recordings, and create original compositions inspired by classical pieces. Employing PySpark, a distributed data processing framework, we managed tasks such as reading, cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing the dataset.Tableau was utilized for visualizing the data. Despite encountering deployment challenges in our primary goal of music generation, we effectively executed data preprocessing, analysis,visualization, and applied machine learning models to forecast musical attributes.

We harnessed PySpark's distributed processing capabilities to efficiently manage the vast MusicNet dataset. The preprocessing phase involved tasks like data cleaning, handling missing values, duplicates, and ensuring consistency.

For a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, we utilized Tableau for data visualization. Interactive visualizations aided in identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Visualization enabled us to grasp the distribution of musical features, explore variations across composers and compositions, and reveal significant characteristics of classical music.

Machine learning models were trained using PySpark's ML library to predict musical attributes. Leveraging algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor, we uncovered correlations and accurately predicted attributes like tempo, pitch, and intensity. This analysis shed light on underlying patterns and structures within classical music.

In summary, our project showcased PySpark's capabilities in handling large-scale data processing and analysis tasks. We successfully conducted data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and applied machine learning models to predict musical features. Although music generation posed challenges due to deployment difficulties, our project provided valuable insights into the MusicNet dataset and classical music compositions.
